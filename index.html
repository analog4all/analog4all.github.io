        <h1>Analog4All</h1>
        <p>Welcome to Analog4all, a free, open source site where people can put their analog synth online for anyone else to play using only their browser.</p>
        <p>How it works:<br>Using a browser, someone can upload a midi file to one of the synths online and it will play that midi file through the synth in realtime and record it. The recording can then be downloaded through the browser.</p>
        <p>To <a href="https://chrisguttandin.github.io/analog4all-provider/">share your synth</a>, you will need for it to be connected to midi and to a sound card. You will also need either Google Chrome or Opera at this time.</p>
        <p>To <a href="https://chrisguttandin.github.io/analog4all-client/">use someone's synth</a> you will just need to upload a standard single instrument midi file using most browsers.</p>
